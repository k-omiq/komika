# Native Page-Image Fetch — Execution Roadmap

**Goal:** production-ready page-image fetch inside the native apps (iOS, Android, desktop) with **zero reliance on
the Cloudflare Worker** *and* **zero reliance on the hosted origin** for image bytes. The Worker (`img.komiq.cc`)
stays for **web only**. **iOS is the stated priority.**

Date: 2026-07-27 · Source: 6-lane native audit (84 findings) + 30 adversarial verdicts + 4 completed fix groups + build gate.
Companion input files: `/home/ubuntu/komiq/komika/.native-audit-raw.json`, `/home/ubuntu/komiq/komika/.native-run2-results.json`.

## 0. The crux — read this before anything else

There are **two different questions** and the codebase answers them differently. Every item below is tagged with
which one it serves.

### Q1 — "Is the native app free of the Cloudflare Worker?" → **YES, already, structurally.**

`createImageProvider` returns `NativeImageProvider` purely on `isTauri()`
(`packages/api/src/image-provider.ts:241`). `NativeImageProvider` never reads `config.workerBaseUrl` — that field
is read at exactly one site, `WebImageProvider.resolve` (`image-provider.ts:76`), which is unreachable inside
Tauri. The reader is a pure client-side SPA in native builds (`apps/reader/src/routes/+layout.ts:11-12`,
`ssr=false; prerender=false`), so no Worker URL can be baked into shipped HTML either. `img.komiq.cc` is
**structurally unreachable from any native build**. It was dead allowance in the native CSP; the packaging fix
this run removed it.

**Q1 is done. Do not spend engineering time on it. Spend it on regression-proofing it (N-IMG.9).**

### Q2 — "Is the native app free of the *hosted server* for image bytes?" → **NO. Not close.**

In production the server rewrites every Suwayomi cover/page URL into an absolute
`https://api.komiq.cc/api/v1/manga/{id}/thumbnail` / `.../chapter/{c}/page/{p}` via `SuwayomiClient::abs`
(`apps/server/src/suwayomi.rs:344-350`, driven by `SUWAYOMI_PUBLIC_URL`; served publicly by `serve_suwayomi_image`,
`apps/server/src/main.rs:584-620`). `NativeImageProvider.resolve` classifies those as neither an engine path (they
are absolute, not `/api/`-rooted) nor MangaDex, so they fall through to `resolveViaLocalProxy` → `fetch_image` →
**our origin**. Three compounding reasons this is the *default* native path, not a fallback:

1. `PUBLIC_KOMIKA_NATIVE_ENGINE=off` in `apps/reader/.env:19`, **not overridden** in `.env.production`, which is
   what `beforeBuildCommand`'s `pnpm build` loads.
2. `CompositeBackend.pages()` is unconditionally hosted (`packages/api/src/composite-backend.ts:244-248`).
3. Even `canonicalPages` only engages when the reader chose the MangaDex spine
   (`apps/reader/src/lib/data/source.ts:1791`).

So: **"no Worker" is done. "no server" is not.** Everything in §1–§6 exists to close Q2 without regressing Q1.

### The third thing that will bite

Even after Q2's plumbing lands, **Cloudflare-gated sources cannot be fetched natively on iOS or Android at all.**
`mod cloudflare` is `#[cfg(desktop)]` (`apps/reader/src-tauri/src/lib.rs:16-17`), and `suwayomi_ios.rs:293`
hard-writes `server.flareSolverrEnabled = false`. Per the pinned engine source (v2.3.2243
`CloudflareInterceptor.kt`) the interceptor's second statement is
`if (!serverConfig.flareSolverrEnabled.value) throw IOException("Cloudflare bypass currently disabled")`. That
throw → `composite-backend.ts:404` `localUnusable.add(workId)` → `:429` serves `hosted.canonicalPages` **for the
rest of the session, silently.** That is the exact dependency the goal removes, for the majority of non-MangaDex
sources. See **§5 (N-CF)**.

## 0a. Provenance and how much to trust each finding

This roadmap is grounded in a 6-lane audit. The lanes were independent subagents. **The evidence is not uniform in
quality and this document does not pretend it is.**

| Tag | Meaning | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `[V]` | Went through adversarial refutation and was **CONFIRMED**. One refuter each, **not a panel**. Several came back with corrected severity or a corrected mechanism, which this roadmap uses in preference to the original finding text. | 27 |
| `[R]` | Went through refutation and was **REFUTED**. Closed. Listed in §8 so nobody re-opens them. | 3 |
| `[U]` | **UNVERIFIED single-pass audit output.** Plausible, cited to file:line, but nothing challenged it. Treat as a lead, not a fact. Confirm the cited lines before acting. | 54 |
| `[FIXED]` | An edit landed in the working tree during this run and passed the build gate. | ~23 |

Additional honesty notes:

- Findings in categories `missing-impl`, `test-gap` and `unverified-claim` were **deliberately excluded from
  auto-fixing** because they are roadmap work, not code defects. They are still real findings — most of this
  roadmap *is* those findings.
- **4 of 6 fix groups completed.** `fix:packaging` died partway on a quota limit. Its edits to `Cargo.toml`,
  `tauri.conf.json`, `scripts/build-jre.sh` and `scripts/stage-ios-jvm-runtime.sh` **are applied and coherent**
  (both scripts pass `bash -n`), but its 7th finding `ios-bundle-size-and-desktop-jre-leak-ungated` is
  **UNADDRESSED** (`tauri.ios.conf.json` unchanged) → **N4.7**. `fix:api-pkg` **never ran**, so
  `android-isready-ipc-per-call` (LOW) is **OPEN** and `packages/api/src/local-suwayomi-backend.ts` is untouched
  → **N-IMG.11**.
- The build gate was run by the orchestrator. Everything is **GREEN**: `cargo check` 0/0, `cargo clippy
  --all-targets -- -D warnings` 0 warnings, `cargo test` **27 passed / 0 failed / 1 ignored** (up from 20),
  `svelte-check` 0 errors / 1 pre-existing warning.

### ⚠ The single most important caveat

`apps/reader/src-tauri/src/suwayomi_ios.rs` is `#[cfg(all(target_os = "ios", target_abi = ""))]` — real-device ABI
only. **It is compiled by no CI job and by no command on this host.** The iOS fixes applied this run — a
restructured `run_jvm` epilogue, a new `invoke_main`, `catch_unwind`, `jvm_options()`, `spawn_heartbeat()`,
`spawn_readiness_gate()`, ~410 changed lines — were therefore written with **zero compiler feedback**. The file was
confirmed to **PARSE** cleanly (`rustfmt --edition 2021 --check`, zero parse errors) but **parsing is not
type-checking**.

The attempt to cross-check it on this host **FAILED**, and not for the reason the audit predicted. The `testgap`
lane recommended a Linux `cargo check --target aarch64-apple-ios` job on the argument that "cargo check never
links, so no Xcode is needed". That argument is wrong: **build scripts still run**, and
`objc2-exception-helper v0.1.1` compiles `src/try_catch.m`, which needs `clang` **and** `xcrun --show-sdk-path` to
locate the iPhoneOS SDK. Neither exists on Linux. See `gate.ios_target_check`.

> **iOS cross-checking cannot be a Linux job. It needs a `macos-latest` runner.** This is corrected in §6.
> **Nothing downstream of `suwayomi_ios.rs` is trustworthy until N4.4 passes.**

## 1. Definition of done

Three gates. A platform ships when it passes its row of **all three**.

### 1.1 Gate I — Worker-free (regression gate, already met)

| # | Assertion | How tested | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-1 | No native build ever constructs an `img.komiq.cc` URL. | `image-provider.check.ts` (N-IMG.9): table of representative URLs asserting the exact `invoke` command + args, incl. a case pinning that **no** input yields a `workerBaseUrl` request. | this Linux host / CI |
| I-2 | Native CSP contains no Worker origin. | grep assertion in the same check, over `tauri.conf.json`. Already true after the packaging fix. | this Linux host / CI |
| I-3 | A device proxy log over a full read session shows **zero** requests to `img.komiq.cc`. | mitmproxy / Charles transcript attached to the device-verify run. | device |

### 1.2 Gate II — Server-independent bytes (the real gap)

**The test must blackhole the hosted origin, not merely observe that it wasn't used.**

> **Canonical test, iOS (the priority platform):**
> On a **physical iPhone**, with `img.komiq.cc` **and** the `api.komiq.cc` image routes (`/api/v1/manga/*`,
> `/covers/*`) blackholed at DNS (or 100%-dropped at the proxy), open **20 consecutive pages across 3 sources** and
> have every page render **from the in-process engine**.

Source matrix — all three legs required, because the path is weakest on the third:

| Leg | Source class | Why it is in the matrix |
|---|---|---|
| A | MangaDex (direct `*.mangadex.network` CDN via `fetch_image`) | The only path proven today. Baseline. |
| B | A non-CF Keiyoushi extension source (engine `/api/...` → `suwayomi_image`) | Exercises the embedded-engine byte path, which is **unreachable in any shipped build today**. |
| C | **A Cloudflare-gated Keiyoushi source** | The weakest link. Today this leg **cannot pass on iOS or Android at all** (§5). It is in the matrix precisely so "done" cannot be declared without it. |

| # | Assertion | Threshold | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| II-1 | 20/20 pages decode and paint, across legs A+B+C. | 100% | Not "20 fetches succeed" — 20 `<img>` elements paint. |
| II-2 | Proxy log shows **zero** egress to `img.komiq.cc` **or** `api.komiq.cc` image routes for the whole session. | 0 bytes | The catalogue/GraphQL calls to `api.komiq.cc/graphql` are **allowed** — this gate is about **image bytes only**. |
| II-3 | `route=` telemetry (landed this run: `log::info!(target: "images", route=hosted\|cdn host=…)` in `lib.rs`) records **0** `route=hosted` lines. | 0 | Requires N-IMG.7's env plumbing for the `hosted` label to be emitted at all — see the caveat in the `lib-rs` fix notes. |
| II-4 | p95 time-to-decoded-bytes per page. | **< 2500 ms** (iOS, Wi-Fi, ~1 MB page) · **< 1500 ms** (desktop) | **Provisional.** Ratified or adjusted by the first N4.3 measurement run. Publish the measured number either way. |
| II-5 | Time-to-first-page after chapter open. | **< 6 s** (iOS) · **< 4 s** (desktop) | Only achievable after **N-IMG.1** kills the eager whole-chapter `Promise.all`. Today this is `ceil(N/6) × latency`. |
| II-6 | Peak app RSS (`phys_footprint` on iOS) with engine `ready` + 20 pages read. | **< 900 MB** (iOS) · **< 1.2 GB** (desktop) | **Provisional**, ratified by N4.3. The refuter's arithmetic put the plausible iOS ceiling near ~800 MB against a ~2 GB foreground jetsam limit on 4 GB devices — so this is a *measurement* gate, not a known failure. |
| II-7 | Zero jetsam kills / zero OOM restarts across the session. | 0 | |
| II-8 | `suwayomi_status` reports `ready` at session end (the new heartbeat must not have degraded it). | `ready` | The post-ready heartbeat landed this run; this asserts it does not false-positive. |
| II-9 | One page failing (force a 502 on one page) yields **19 rendered + 1 error tile**, not "No pages available". | — | Regression gate on the `Promise.allSettled` fix that landed this run, plus **N-IMG.2**. |

### 1.3 Gate III — Shippable build

| # | Assertion | Where |
|---|---|---|
| III-1 | A CI-produced bundle (not a laptop build) contains the engine artifacts: desktop `jre/<slug>/bin/java*` + `suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server.jar`; iOS `assets/suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server.jar` + `lib/lib/modules` and **no** `assets/jre/`. | CI |
| III-2 | Bundle size under an explicit, enforced ceiling per platform. | CI |
| III-3 | The bundle ships **no internal docs** (today `bundle.resources: ["suwayomi/"]` ships `GQL-SCHEMA-FINDINGS.md`, `N-CF-SPIKE-FINDINGS.md`, `SPIKE-FINDINGS.md` to end users). | CI |
| III-4 | Cold start `< 30 s` **asserted with a measured elapsed time**, not merely a 60 s budget that nothing times. | CI |
| III-5 | A release build emits diagnosable logs (logger is now unconditional — verify the log file is reachable on each platform). | device |

### 1.4 Per-platform done

| Platform | Gate I | Gate II legs | Gate III | Realistic status today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Desktop** | ✅ met | A ✅ (proven in a mocked harness only) · B 🟡 engine exists, flag off · C 🟡 shim exists, 3 protocol defects | ❌ no bundling job at all | Demo-ready, not production-ready |
| **iOS** | ✅ met | A 🟡 · B ❌ never booted on hardware · C ❌ **no solver exists** | ❌ unreproducible Xcode project, no CI | **Never compiled.** Start at N4.4. |
| **Android** | ✅ met | A 🟡 (hosted proxy only) · B ❌ **total stub** · C ❌ **no solver exists** | ❌ nothing exists | Stub. Start at N3.0. |

## 2. Workstream index (dependency-ordered)

ID bands continue the existing N-scheme. **N-IMG** = image path (cross-platform). **N-CF** = Cloudflare.
**N4.x** = iOS. **N3.x** = Android. **N1.x/N5.x** = desktop. **N-CI** = CI.

Size: **S** ≤ 1 day · **M** 2–5 days · **L** > 1 week.
Where: `linux` = this host · `macos` = a macOS runner or Mac · `device` = physical iPhone/Android · `display` = a
machine with a GUI session (desktop CF solver work) · `android-sdk` = a host with Android SDK+NDK.

### 2.1 Dependency graph (abridged)

## 3. Critical path to the first end-to-end iOS device proof

**Short by design. Everything not on this list is parallel work.**

| Order | Item | Why it is here | Size | Where | Blocker type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **N4.4 — `cargo check --target aarch64-apple-ios` on macOS** | **31 KB of unsafe JNI has never been compiled by anything, and this run just edited it blind.** Nothing downstream is trustworthy until this passes. Cheapest, highest-value step on the whole path. | **S** | **macos** | **human: needs a macOS runner enabled or a Mac** |
| 2 | N4.5 — reconcile `DetachCurrentThread` vs `DestroyJavaVM` on the VM-owning thread | The applied fix calls `DetachCurrentThread`; the refuter established the JNI Invocation API forbids detaching the VM-creating thread and requires `DestroyJavaVM`. Must be settled **with a compiler and a device**, not by reading. | S | macos + device | technical |
| 3 | N4.6 — tracked iOS Xcode project template | The entire link recipe (13 `force_load`s, `DEAD_CODE_STRIPPING=false`, the bundle-root `lib/` folder ref) lives only in gitignored, hand-edited `gen/apple/project.yml`. **No fresh clone and no CI can reproduce a working iOS build.** | M | macos | technical |
| 4 | N4.7 — iOS bundle verifier + size ceiling | The unaddressed 7th packaging finding. Without it, III-1/III-2 cannot be asserted and the 218 MB desktop-JRE leak has no regression guard. | S | macos | technical |
| 5 | N-IMG.1 — lazy windowed page resolution | Without it, a 20-page leg-B read pulls **all** bytes before first paint through a 6-permit semaphore. II-5 is unreachable and II-6 is at risk. Runs entirely on this Linux host, so it can be done **in parallel with 1–4**. | M | linux | technical |
| 6 | N4.3 — on-device cold-start + RSS measurement | Ratifies or moves the provisional II-4/II-6 thresholds and settles `-Xss4m` / `-Xmx256m` / metaspace. | M | device | **human: needs a physical iPhone + a provisioning profile** |
| 7 | **N4.9 — first end-to-end device read (legs A+B)** | The proof the user is asking for. | M | device | **human: device + Apple developer account** |
| 8 | N-CF.11 + N-CF.12 — iOS Cloudflare solver | **Leg C only.** Deliberately *after* the first proof, because A+B is a legitimate, demonstrable milestone and C is an L-sized workstream. | L | macos + device | technical |

### 3.1 Earliest honest test date

Steps 1–4 are gated on **a macOS machine or an enabled `macos-latest` runner** and nothing else — that is the
single human-action blocker on the front half. With a Mac in hand, 1–4 is realistically **3–6 working days**,
with N4.6 the long pole and a real chance N4.4 surfaces a batch of type errors in the blind edits (budget a day
for that; the compile risk was self-assessed as "low-to-moderate" by the fix agent, which had no compiler).

Steps 6–7 need **a physical iPhone plus a paid Apple Developer account for on-device provisioning**. That is a
second, independent human-action blocker.

> **Earliest honest date for the first end-to-end iOS device proof (legs A+B): ~2 calendar weeks after a Mac and a
> provisioned device are both available.** Not before. Any date quoted without both blockers cleared is fiction.
>
> **Leg C (Cloudflare-gated) is a further L-sized workstream and should be quoted separately.**

If only *one* of the two can be obtained now, get the **Mac** first: N4.4 alone converts 843 lines of
never-compiled code from "unknown" to "known", and it is a one-command step.

## 4. N-IMG — the image path (cross-platform)

Serves **Q2**. Every item here runs on **this Linux host** unless stated.

| ID | Goal | Files | Acceptance | Size | Deps | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **N-IMG.0** `[FIXED]` | One failed page no longer empties the chapter (`Promise.allSettled` + `''` url). | `apps/reader/src/lib/data/source.ts` | Landed; svelte-check green. | — | — | done |
| **N-IMG.1** `[V]` | **Lazy windowed page resolution.** Kill the eager whole-chapter byte pull. | `packages/api/src/image-provider.ts` (on-demand + abortable resolve), `apps/reader/src/routes/read/[slug]/+page.svelte` (sliding window + revoke bookkeeping), `apps/reader/src/lib/data/source.ts` | Reader `load` resolves ≤ 3 pages; the rest resolve on visibility; blobs outside the window are released via `images.release`. A 200-page webtoon paints page 1 in < 4 s desktop / < 6 s iOS. No `Promise.all` over all pages remains in `source.ts`. | M | — | linux |
| **N-IMG.2** `[U]` | **Real per-page retry.** `retryImage(i)` re-invokes `images.resolvePage(page)` instead of remounting an `<img>` around a URL that was never produced. | `apps/reader/src/routes/read/[slug]/+page.svelte` | A page with `url === ''` renders the **retry tile**, not the generic `PAGE nn` placeholder (today the retry branch is gated on `p.url` being truthy, so the fix that landed this run produces a dead tile). Also: gate the view-count ping on "≥1 page has a url" — today an all-failed chapter now counts as a view. | S | N-IMG.0 | linux |
| **N-IMG.3** `[U]` | **Per-source request headers.** `fetch_image` has no channel for Referer/UA/Cookie/Accept, so the direct path 403s on any hotlink-protected source. | `apps/reader/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `packages/types/src/index.ts` (`Page.headers?`), `packages/api/src/*-backend.ts` | `fetch_image(url, headers?)` with an **allowlist** (`Referer`, `User-Agent`, `Cookie`, `Accept`) — never a passthrough map. `Accept: image/*,*/*;q=0.8` sent by default (the Worker does this; native does not). Backends populate `Page.headers` from the source record. Unit test per allowlisted/rejected header. | M | — | linux |
| **N-IMG.4** `[U]` | **Content-Type validation + typed Blob.** | `lib.rs`, `suwayomi.rs`, `suwayomi_ios.rs`, `image-provider.ts` | Non-`image/*` upstream is rejected with a clear error (mirrors `apps/worker/src/index.ts`'s `isImageContentType`). The command returns the content type alongside bytes; JS does `new Blob([bytes], { type })`. A 200-HTML-interstitial produces a diagnosable error, not a typeless blob. | S | — | linux |
| **N-IMG.5** `[U]` | **Restore IPv4 fallback + fix IPv6 literals.** | `apps/reader/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` | `ClientBuilder::resolve_to_addrs(&host, &addrs)` with the **full validated list** instead of `.resolve(&host, addrs[0])` — keeps the rebinding defence, restores Happy-Eyeballs-ish fallback. Explicit `.connect_timeout` shorter than the total budget. `host_str()`'s brackets stripped (or `Host::Ipv6` handled directly) so IPv6 literals reach `is_blocked_ip`; the existing `rejects_loopback_and_lan_literals` test is a **false positive** today (it proves DNS failed, not that the v6 guard works) — rewrite it to distinguish `non-public address` from `dns lookup failed`. | S | — | linux |
| **N-IMG.6** `[U]` | **Explicit page-origin tag; make `pages()` engine-aware.** The `startsWith('/api/')` discriminator is a latent collision: if `SUWAYOMI_PUBLIC_URL` is ever empty the server emits **relative** `/api/v1/manga/…`, which `isEnginePath` misroutes into the embedded engine with hosted integer ids. | `packages/types/src/index.ts` (`Page.origin: 'engine'\|'cdn'\|'hosted'`), `packages/api/src/composite-backend.ts:244-248`, `image-provider.ts:182-184` | `NativeImageProvider` routes on the explicit tag, never on a path prefix. `CompositeBackend.pages()` consults the engine the way `canonicalPages` does. A relative hosted path can never be mistaken for an engine path (covered by N-IMG.9's table). | M | N-IMG.3 | linux |
| **N-IMG.7** `[U]` | **Flip the native default + runtime override.** | `apps/reader/.env.production`, `apps/reader/src/lib/config.ts`, `apps/reader/src/lib/context.ts`, `apps/reader/src-tauri/build.rs` | Per-platform native-engine default flipped **only after** that platform's device proof. A `localStorage` `imageMode` / `nativeEngine` override so device verification can flip paths **without a rebuild**. `build.rs` forwards `PUBLIC_KOMIKA_API` / `PUBLIC_KOMIKA_NATIVE_ENGINE` as `cargo:rustc-env` — **required** for the landed SSRF-origin exemption and the `route=hosted` telemetry label to work at all in shipped builds. `context.ts` calls the new `invoke('suwayomi_start')` when `config.nativeEngine && isTauri()`. | M | N4.9 / N3.7 | linux |
| **N-IMG.8** `[V]` | **Avatars and comment media.** CSP now permits `api.komiq.cc` in `img-src` (landed), but the no-remote-origin posture wants these as blobs. | `apps/reader/src/lib/config.ts` (`apiAssetSrc`), `Avatar.svelte`, `CommentThread.svelte`, `packages/api/src/.../social-repo.ts:163` **and `:434`** (the post-upload preview, missed by the original finding) | Avatar + comment media resolve through `images.resolveCover` → `blob:`. Note the class of bug: this was invisible in `tauri dev` because the dev server does not carry the bundled CSP. | S | — | linux |
| **N-IMG.9** `[V]` | **Deterministic routing check for `image-provider.ts`** — the user's headline goal has **zero automated coverage of any kind**. | new `apps/reader/src-tauri/e2e/image-routing/` (same shape as `fallback-ladder.check.ts`: esbuild + node, no Tauri) | Table of representative URLs asserting the **exact command name and args** invoked: (a) native never yields a `workerBaseUrl` request; (b) `/api/...` → `suwayomi_image`; (c) absolute CDN → `fetch_image`; (d) own-origin `/covers/`,`/avatars/` → `fetch_image` with `apiOrigin` prefix; (e) a **relative hosted** `/api/v1/manga/...` does **not** route to the engine. Wired into CI by N-CI.3. | S | — | linux |
| **N-IMG.10** `[FIXED]` | Cover blob leak on in-flight unmount. | `apps/reader/src/lib/components/Cover.svelte` | Landed: `!alive` now releases the just-minted object URL. | — | — | done |
| **N-IMG.11** `[V]` | `isReady()` IPC round-trip per content call (the fix group that never ran). | `packages/api/src/local-suwayomi-backend.ts`, `composite-backend.ts` | **Do NOT cache the first `false` for the session** — the refuter established that would permanently disable the desktop engine after any transient degrade, contradicting the explicit "not-ready is transient and is never memoed" contract at `composite-backend.ts:343-346`. Implement only: short-TTL promise memo, re-probe while state is `starting`, latch permanently **only** on a platform-permanent unavailability signal from Rust. | S | — | linux |

---

## 5. N-CF — header fidelity and the Cloudflare challenge

**This is the true blocker for server-independent fetch on gated sources.** Two independent problems:

1. **No per-source header channel at all** on the direct path (`fetch_image` hardcodes
   `User-Agent: Komika/0.1` at `lib.rs:65` and a self-referential Referer at `:69-76`) → **N-IMG.3**.
2. **No CF solver on mobile**, plus three concrete protocol defects on desktop.

### 5.1 The three protocol defects (found by the `cfshim` lane, diffed against the pinned engine source)

| Defect | Mechanism | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **Null domain** `[U]` | `FsCookie.domain` is `Option<String>` with `#[serde(default)]` and no `skip_serializing_if`, so `None` serializes as `"domain": null`. The pinned engine declares `FlareSolverSolutionCookie(val name: String, val value: String, val domain: String, …)` — **non-nullable**; kotlinx throws. wry's WebKitGTK path can produce a domain-less cookie (`webkitgtk/mod.rs:938` sets a domain only `if let Some(..)`). | **One** domain-less analytics cookie in the jar poisons the **entire** solve response, including a perfectly good `cf_clearance`. |
| **Dot-stripping** `[U]` | The `cookie` crate deliberately strips a leading dot (`cookie-0.18.1/src/lib.rs:777-785`). The engine branches on exactly that dot: `if (!cookie.domain.startsWith('.')) it.hostOnlyDomain(...)`. Real FlareSolverr sources cookies from CDP, which preserves `.example.com`. | **Every** injected `cf_clearance` is downgraded to **host-only** and never covers the subdomains that actually serve pages (`cdn.`/`img1.`/`s3.`). Every distinct image host costs a full solve. |
| **Budget inversion** `[U]` | `MAX_SOLVE_WALL_MS = 45_000` and `INTERACTIVE_GRACE = 8s` (`cloudflare.rs:51,55`) vs `HTTP_TIMEOUT = 30s` on the client carrying `suwayomi_gql` (`suwayomi.rs:35`). Engine budget is `flareSolverrTimeout + 10s` = 70 s. | A **slow-but-successful** solve still fails the IPC call, and `composite-backend.ts:404` memoises the work `localUnusable` for the session — the engine sits holding a perfectly good clearance nobody will use until app restart. |

### 5.2 Workstream

| **N-CF.1** `[U]` | Fix the cookie contract. | `cloudflare.rs:513-526` | Never emit a null domain (fall back to the request URL host, or drop the cookie). Re-prefix a dot when the cookie domain is a proper suffix of the host; always for `cf_clearance`. Unit tests asserting `solution.cookies[*].domain` is non-null **and** dot-prefixed for `cf_clearance`, documented as the engine's hard contract. | S | — | linux |
| **N-CF.2** `[U]` | Make the timeout ladder monotonic: shim wall cap **<** engine `callTimeout` **<** transport timeout. | `cloudflare.rs:51,55`, `suwayomi.rs:35`, `composite-backend.ts:399-407` | Either raise the content-query transport timeout above the 70 s engine budget, or drop the hidden-phase cap well under 30 s and move the interactive phase **off** the request path. **And**: stop memoising `localUnusable` on transport **timeouts** specifically. | S | — | linux |
| **N-CF.3** `[U]` | Don't return the already-rejected clearance. | `cloudflare.rs:485-496` | Snapshot/delete the target domain's `cf_clearance` before `build_challenge_window`; require absent→present or a changed value before treating it as solved. Test: a pre-existing cookie does **not** short-circuit. | S | — | linux |
| **N-CF.4** `[U]` | **Authenticate the loopback shim.** Today `/v1` is an unauthenticated "navigate the app's WebView to URL X and hand me every cookie for X" oracle, with a self-identifying `komika-cf-shim` health banner. | `cloudflare.rs:318-358,429-446,513-526`, `suwayomi.rs:590-597` | 128-bit per-boot token, required as a header **or** as a path segment (`flareSolverrUrl = http://127.0.0.1:<port>/<token>` — the engine appends `/v1`, so a path prefix needs **zero** engine changes), constant-time compared. Drop/randomise the banner. Restrict solvable URLs to hosts the engine has an installed source for. Filter `to_fs_cookies` to `cf_clearance` + cookies already present inbound. **Gate `cloudflare::start` on the native-engine flag** (today the listener opens for 100% of desktop installs, including users who never enable the engine). | M | — | linux |
| **N-CF.5** `[U]` | Make the listener and shutdown robust. | `cloudflare.rs:277-291,340-345,347-357,378-384` | Body read capped (`.take(64 KiB)`) with a socket read timeout, read **off** the serving thread. `shutdown()`'s `join()` bounded (today `unblock()` cannot interrupt a thread parked in `read_to_string`, and `Drop` runs at app quit → **hang on exit**). Replace `Notify::notify_waiters` with a level-triggered `watch`/`CancellationToken`. Add a solve semaphore (1–2 permits) + per-host in-flight dedupe. Test: oversized/truncated body → fast 4xx, listener still serves the next request. | M | — | linux |
| **N-CF.6** `[U]` | UA fidelity. | `cloudflare.rs:61-62,460,494` | `eval("navigator.userAgent")` back through a JS→Rust channel and echo **that** string as `solution.userAgent`; fall back to the constant only if the eval fails. Prefer leaving the webview UA at its native default over spoofing Chrome/124 onto WebKit/WebView2 — the engine's `setUserAgent` callback unifies the UA **globally**, so one solve retroactively makes every request (MangaDex included) claim a stale Chrome 124. | S | — | display |
| **N-CF.7** `[U]` | Inject seed cookies. The current comment ("Tauri exposes no pre-nav cookie-set API") is **stale** — `WebviewWindow::set_cookie` exists in tauri 2.11.5. | `cloudflare.rs:413-416` | Seed cookies set before/at navigation. Test with a login-gated fixture: a members-only source no longer redirects the hidden WebView to `/login`. | S | — | display |
| **N-CF.8** `[U]` | `request.post` handling. | `cloudflare.rs:96-99,457` | For `cmd == "request.post"`, navigate the URL's **origin** (host-scoped clearance) rather than GETting a POST-only path; or inject+submit a form from the parsed `postData`. At minimum record the limitation in the module docs and §8b. | S | — | display |
| **N-CF.9** `[U]` | `apply_settings` race. | `suwayomi.rs:406-414`, `cloudflare.rs:557-598` | `apply_settings` **awaited with bounded retry before** the Ready transition (or gate `ready_endpoint()`/`suwayomi_status` on a `cf_wired` flag). A hard failure becomes `Degraded` with a reason, not a warn-only log. Today a single request landing in the startup gap poisons that work's `localUnusable` for the whole session. | S | — | linux |
| **N-CF.10** `[U]` | Get blocking calls off Tauri's shared tokio workers (`recv_timeout(10s)` + 400 ms `cookies_for_url` polls park workers that `suwayomi_gql`/`fetch_image` also need; on a 2-core machine one solve freezes the reader). Also fix the **stale docs** — `CfShim::start`'s comment and `Cargo.toml:34-35` both describe a `block_on` design that no longer exists. | `cloudflare.rs:467,489`, `Cargo.toml` | `spawn_blocking` (or async channel + `tokio::time::timeout`). Docs describe the actual spawn-per-request design. | S | — | linux |
| **N-CF.11** `[U]` | **Extract a platform-neutral shim.** `tiny_http` + `FsReq`/`FsResp` + `handle_v1` are already platform-neutral; only `WebviewSolver` is desktop-shaped. | `lib.rs:16-17`, `cloudflare.rs` → `cloudflare/{mod,shim,solver_desktop}.rs` | `mod cloudflare` no longer `#[cfg(desktop)]`. A `CloudflareSolver` trait with a desktop impl. Existing 7 tests still green on all three desktop OSes. **Blocking for N-CF.12/13.** | L | N-CF.1..10 | linux |
| **N-CF.12** `[U]` | **iOS solver.** | new `cloudflare/solver_ios.rs`, `suwayomi_ios.rs:293` | WKWebView + `WKHTTPCookieStore` behind the trait; flip `server.flareSolverrEnabled = true` and call `apply_settings`. **Hazard:** Tauri's multi-window story on iOS is unproven and a hidden/off-screen WKWebView may be JS-throttled — **plan for an in-view, user-visible sheet**, not a hidden window. Acceptance = Gate II **leg C** on device. | L | N-CF.11, N4.4 | macos + device |
| **N-CF.13** `[U]` | **Android solver.** Tauri's own cookie API is **documented as always returning an empty Vec on Android** (tauri 2.11.5 `webview/mod.rs:2167-2169`), so a Kotlin plugin is **mandatory**, not optional. | new Kotlin `@TauriPlugin` (`solve(url)` / `getCookie(url)` / `userAgent()`) over `android.webkit.CookieManager` + a `WebViewClient`; `cloudflare/solver_android.rs` | Harvested `{cf_clearance, UA}` threaded into the shim. UA unified WebView ↔ shim ↔ engine OkHttp. Acceptance = Gate II leg C on an Android device. Same as **N3.6**. | L | N-CF.11, N3.2 | android-sdk + device |
| **N-CF.14** `[U]` | **Fallback policy — make the silence stop.** | `composite-backend.ts:399-407,420-430`, reader UI | See §5.3. | S | — | linux |

### 5.3 Fallback policy — what the app does on a gated source with no solver

Today the behaviour is: **fail once, memoise forever, serve from the hosted proxy, tell nobody.** That is
unacceptable for a product whose headline claim is server independence, because it makes the claim silently false.
The policy, in priority order:

1. **Never silent.** Every `localUnusable.add(workId)` emits a structured log/telemetry event naming the work, the
   source, and the reason (`cf-disabled` / `cf-solve-timeout` / `transport-timeout` / `engine-not-ready`). This is
   the only way the hosted-fallback **rate** becomes measurable. Do this first; it is an S and it unblocks
   measuring everything else.
2. **Distinguish transient from permanent.** Do **not** memoise on transport timeouts (N-CF.2) or on
   `engine not ready` during boot (N-CF.9). Memoise only on a genuine per-work capability failure.
3. **Platform-honest degradation.** On a platform with **no solver** (iOS/Android until N-CF.12/13), a CF-gated
   source is **declared unsupported natively** and falls back to hosted **with a visible, dismissible one-time
   notice on that series**: *"This source uses Cloudflare protection. Pages are being loaded through Komika's
   servers on this device."* Not a broken tile, not silence.
4. **Offline is honest too.** With the hosted origin unreachable **and** no solver, the reader shows an explicit
   *"This source can't be read offline on this device yet"* state — **not** "No pages available", which today is
   what a user sees and which is indistinguishable from a bug.
5. **A kill-switch exists.** The `imageMode` runtime override (N-IMG.7) lets support force a device back to the
   hosted path without a rebuild if the engine path misbehaves in the field.
6. **§0a of the plan of record states which platforms support CF-gated sources**, and is updated when
   N-CF.12/13 land. Today it does not, which is how "iOS complete" got written down.

## 6. N4 — iOS

**Everything here is unverified by a compiler.** `suwayomi_ios.rs` is `#[cfg(all(target_os = "ios", target_abi =
""))]` — the `macabi` fix landed this run, so Mac Catalyst now falls back to the stub as intended, but
`build.rs:47-50` **still gates the `jre-ios` link flags on `abi != "sim"`** and **must be changed to match** or
Catalyst gets the stub module with device `.a` files (flagged by the `lib-rs` fix agent as cross-file remainder #1).

| ID | Goal | Files | Acceptance | Size | Deps | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **N4.4** `[V]` | **Compile it. At all.** | `.github/workflows/native-sidecar.yml` | A `macos-latest` job runs `cargo check --target aarch64-apple-ios --all-targets` **green**, then `--target aarch64-apple-ios-sim`. Promote to `cargo clippy --target aarch64-apple-ios -- -D warnings` once green. **Cannot be a Linux job** — see §0a. | S | macOS access | **macos** |
| **N4.5** `[V]` | Reconcile detach-vs-destroy; JNI local-ref hygiene. | `suwayomi_ios.rs` (`run_jvm`/`invoke_main` epilogue) | The applied fix calls `DetachCurrentThread`; the JNI Invocation API states the VM-creating thread **cannot** be detached and must call `DestroyJavaVM` (which, since the erroring thread is then the only non-daemon thread, returns promptly and reclaims the 256 MB reservation). Settle this **with a compiler and a device**. Also add the deliberately-deferred `DeleteLocalRef`/`PushLocalFrame`+`PopLocalFrame` around class/argv refs — skipped this run because `jni-sys 0.3.1` is an iOS-only dep and is not vendored on this host, so the field names could not be verified. | S | N4.4 | macos + device |
| **N4.6** `[V]` | **Tracked iOS project template.** | new `apps/reader/src-tauri/ios/project.yml` (or a `.patch`) + `scripts/apply-ios-project.sh`; extend `scripts/stage-ios-jvm-runtime.sh` | `tauri ios init` followed by the apply script reproduces a working link recipe from a **fresh clone**. The staging guard asserts **every** required setting — each of the 13 `force_load` entries, `DEAD_CODE_STRIPPING=false`, `-lz`/`-liconv`/`-lc++`, the `jvm-runtime/lib` folder ref — not the three substrings it greps today. Fix the guard's error text, which points at `docs/plans/n4-ios-spike.md` for the recipe; **no `.md` in the repo contains the string `force_load`** — the only surviving copy is the doc-comment at `build.rs:20-40`. | M | N4.4 | macos |
| **N4.7** `[V]` `[OPEN]` | **iOS bundle verifier.** The unaddressed 7th packaging finding. | new `scripts/verify-ios-bundle.sh`; `tauri.ios.conf.json` | Asserts the `.app` contains `assets/suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server.jar` **and** `lib/lib/modules`, contains **no** `assets/jre/`, and is under an explicit size ceiling (desktop has a 150 MB `jlink` ceiling enforced in CI; iOS has none). Called from the staging script and from the new iOS CI job. **Note:** the refuter established the 218 MB desktop-JRE leak is very likely **already fixed** (`tauri.ios.conf.json` pins resources to the jar; `jre/` appears only in `tauri.macos.conf.json`) — so this is a **regression guard and a size budget**, not a live defect. Severity corrected medium → **low**; it is on the critical path only because Gate III-1/III-2 cannot be asserted without it. | S | N4.6 | macos |
| **N4.3** *(existing id)* `[U]` | **On-device cold-start + RSS measurement.** Never run. | measurement only | Publishes: cold-start ms, peak `phys_footprint`, peak engine thread count, metaspace high-water. **Ratifies or moves II-4/II-6.** Settles `-Xss4m` (raised from `1m` this run — note dropping the flag entirely is a **no-op**, HotSpot's BSD/aarch64 default is already 1 MiB, so only *raising* it changes anything), `-Xmx256m`, and whether metaspace needs a cap. **Do not pre-emptively add `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m`** — the refuter established that plausibly triggers `OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace` against Kotlin + Suwayomi + per-extension classloaders and kills the engine outright. | M | N4.4, N4.6, N4.7 | **device** |
| **N4.8** *(existing id)* `[U]` | **iOS lifecycle / jetsam.** Zero lifecycle code exists; the only shutdown hook is `RunEvent::Exit`, which iOS never delivers (suspended apps are SIGKILLed). | `suwayomi_ios.rs`, possibly a small Swift plugin | On background: mark `stopped`, cancel in-flight engine IPC (today reqwest calls hold 60 s timeouts against a frozen loopback server). On memory warning: drop caches, `System.gc` via a retained `JavaVM` handle. On foreground: short `aboutServer` probe → back to `ready` or `degraded`. Store the `*mut JavaVM` in the supervisor so a foreground attach is possible at all. **Note `boot_attempted` latches**, so there is currently no second boot in a process — the lifecycle design must decide whether that stays. | L | N4.4, N4.3 | macos + device |
| **N4.9** `[U]` | **First end-to-end device read (legs A+B).** | runbook execution | Gate II legs A+B, all assertions, with the proxy transcript attached. This is **the milestone**. | M | N4.3, N-IMG.1, N-IMG.3 | **device** |
| **N4.10** `[U]` | **Correct the plan of record.** `grep -n "N4" docs/plans/native-embedded-suwayomi.md` returns only the two *spike* lines; §0a still reads "green-light the N4 gating prototype" while 843 lines of device-only Rust are committed. | `docs/plans/native-embedded-suwayomi.md`, `suwayomi_ios.rs:12-27,421-422` | §0a gains an N4.2 entry stating exactly what landed, what is unbuilt (CF, lifecycle, N4.3 measurements), and the standing "never booted on hardware". Downgrade the in-code "verified against the pinned openjdk/mobile sources" / "verified from META-INF/MANIFEST.MF" language to "derived from sources, **unverified on device**". **There is currently no single honest place a reader can learn that iOS ships an engine that has never booted.** | S | — | linux |
| **N4.11** `[V]` | Field diagnostics reachable on iOS. The logger is now registered unconditionally (landed), which matters **most** on iOS: the engine is **in-process**, so there is no stdout/stderr pipe at all and `log::` is the **only** diagnostic channel — a TestFlight build previously emitted nothing whatsoever. | `lib.rs` (done), reader settings | Verify the rotating log file is reachable on iOS and add a share-sheet export so a user can send it. Attach the last N engine stderr lines to `lastError`. | S | N4.4 | device |

## 7. N3 — Android: from total stub to in-process JVM parity

### 7.1 Ground truth

`suwayomi_mobile.rs` is a **pure stub**: `start()` is a single `log::info!` (`:69-71`), `suwayomi_status` returns a
hard-coded `state:"degraded"` (`:84-91`), `suwayomi_gql`/`suwayomi_image` unconditionally `Err` (`:95-112`).
`lib.rs:23-28` routes Android there. A repo-wide grep over `apps/reader/src-tauri/` finds **zero** occurrences of
`target_os = "android"`, `jniLibs`, `CookieManager`, `dlopen`, or a foreground `Service`. There is no
`tauri.android.conf.json`, no `gen/android` (never generated), no Android JDK build script, and no Android job in
`native-sidecar.yml`. `jni-sys` is declared only under `[target.'cfg(target_os = "ios")'.dependencies]`, so Android
could not even reference the JNI ABI today. **Zero of N3.2–N3.9 exists.**

### 7.2 ⚠ The `android-jdk-probe` "N3.1 PASS" proves almost nothing about Android

`e2e/android-jdk-probe/run.sh:34-35,128-135` runs
`docker run --platform linux/arm64 eclipse-temurin:21 java -verbose:class … -jar /engine/Suwayomi-Server.jar`.
That is:

- a **glibc** Linux userland, **not bionic**;
- started by **`execve`-ing the `java` launcher** — *precisely* the model `n3-android-spike.md:158-166` says the
  API-29 W^X/exec ban rules out;
- it **never calls `JNI_CreateJavaVM`**, which is N3.2's stated acceptance ("one process, no `execve`").

It therefore transfers exactly one architecture-independent claim: **the stock jar's bytecode + the pure-Java
dex2jar/H2/Exposed path run on an aarch64 JDK 21.** Untested by it: bionic `dlopen` of a bundled `libjvm.so`, ART
coexistence, the foreground-service requirement, `nativeLibraryDir` exec legality, app-private storage paths,
**16 KB page size on Android 15+**, Doze/background death, JIT-vs-Zero on device. And N3.1's own acceptance text
demands a jlink'd, size-budgeted arm64 JDK artifact (**does not exist** — the probe used the stock 300+ MB
container) and **GraalJS init**, which `FINDINGS.md` itself states did **not** happen ("0 `com.oracle.truffle`
class-loads here (expected)").

> **All remaining Android runtime risk is 100% live despite a green probe.** §0a must be downgraded to
> **N3.1 PARTIAL** (→ N3.1c) and a real probe is a work item (→ N3.1b).

### 7.3 Workstream

| ID | Goal | Files | Acceptance | Size | Deps | Where | Android-specific hazards |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **N3.0** `[U]` | **Extract `suwayomi_core.rs`.** No shared abstraction exists between the iOS supervisor and a future Android one — `lib.rs:16-28` selects exactly ONE `suwayomi` module per target via `#[path]` aliasing. Roughly **500 of `suwayomi_ios.rs`'s 843 lines are platform-neutral**: supervisor + state machine (`:109-215`), `broker_port`/`port_is_bindable`/`acquire_boot_port` (`:220-278`), `render_server_conf`/`prepare_data_dir` (`:285-306`), `poll_ready` (`:310-344`), `validate_image_path`/`percent_decode_once` (`:658-703`), and the four IPC commands (`:619-843`). | new `src/suwayomi_core.rs`; `suwayomi_ios.rs` shrinks to ~250 lines | Genuinely iOS-only surface left behind: (a) `JNI_CreateJavaVM` as a **statically linked** symbol — Android must `dlopen("libjvm.so")` + `dlsym`; (b) `check_bundled_runtime`'s `<exe dir>/lib` java.home derivation; (c) the `-Xmx256m` jetsam cap and Zero-sized `JVM_THREAD_STACK`; (d) the one-boot-per-process/no-`DestroyJavaVM` policy, which on Android becomes a foreground-service restart. **Sizing: L** — it is a ~500-line move plus a trait, and it must be done **without a compiler for the iOS side** until N4.4 exists, which is why it is sequenced after N4.4. | **L** | **N4.4** | macos (to verify iOS side) + linux | Doing this *after* N3.2 means a copy-paste fork that drifts — and the first thing to drift will be `validate_image_path`, a **security-relevant** guard, across two shipping platforms. |
| **N3.1b** `[U]` | **An honest Android runtime probe.** | new `e2e/android-jni-probe/` | Boots the jar via `JNI_CreateJavaVM` from a **bionic** process on a real Android device/emulator, **no `execve`**, reaching `aboutServer`. Records cold start and RSS. | M | N3.8 (needs the JDK artifact) | android-sdk + device | bionic `dlopen`; ART coexistence in the same process; `nativeLibraryDir` exec legality |
| **N3.1c** `[U]` | Retitle the existing probe + close N3.1's real acceptance. | `e2e/android-jdk-probe/FINDINGS.md`, `docs/plans/native-embedded-suwayomi.md` §0a, `n3-android-spike.md` §4a | Probe retitled to exactly what it proves, with an explicit **"does NOT cover"** list. §0a downgraded to **N3.1 PARTIAL** with two carried-forward items: (a) build + size-budget a jlink'd arm64 Android JDK; (b) **force a GraalJS eval** and record init cost + jar footprint. | S | — | linux | GraalJS/Truffle init on a bundled Android JDK is spike risk R4 and is **entirely unretired** — JS-dependent Keiyoushi sources are unproven |
| **N3.2** `[U]` | **In-process JVM launcher.** | new `src/suwayomi_android.rs`; `Cargo.toml` (move `jni-sys` to a shared/android target table) | `dlopen`s the bundled `libjvm.so` from `nativeLibraryDir` and `dlsym`s `JNI_CreateJavaVM` (Android **cannot** use the iOS static-link trick), reusing `suwayomi_core`'s supervisor, port broker and readiness gate. One process, **no `execve`**. | L | N3.0, N3.8 | android-sdk | **API-29 W^X/exec ban** — this is why a child process is off the table entirely; **16 KB page size on Android 15+** — the `.so` must be 16 KB-aligned or `dlopen` fails on modern devices |
| **N3.3** `[U]` | **Foreground service owning VM lifetime.** | new Kotlin service + manifest | The JVM lives in a foreground service so Doze/background process death does not kill a mid-read engine. Notification channel + user-visible notification per platform policy. | M | N3.2 | android-sdk + device | **Foreground service** type declaration and the Android 14 FGS-type restrictions; Doze; background process death; battery-optimisation prompts |
| **N3.4** `[U]` | Loopback reachability. | `network_security_config.xml`, manifest | Cleartext to `127.0.0.1` explicitly permitted for the app; nothing else loosened. | S | N3.2 | android-sdk | On Android **loopback is shared device-wide** — any co-installed app can bind the same port. The engine's new Basic-auth (landed for desktop) is **load-bearing here**, not optional. |
| **N3.6** `[U]` | **Cloudflare bridge** = **N-CF.13**. | Kotlin `@TauriPlugin` + `solver_android.rs` | See §5.2. | L | N-CF.11, N3.2 | android-sdk + device | **Tauri-Android's cookie API is documented as always returning an empty `Vec`** — a Kotlin `CookieManager` plugin is mandatory, not a shortcut |
| **N3.8** `[U]` | **Packaging.** Base `bundle.resources` is `[]`; per-OS overrides exist only for desktop and iOS. `bundle.android` sets only `debugApplicationIdSuffix`. | new `tauri.android.conf.json`; new `scripts/build-jdk-android.sh`; generated Gradle config; `.gitignore` | `tauri.android.conf.json` bundles `suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server.jar` as an asset. `build-jdk-android.sh` produces a **16 KB-page-aligned arm64-v8a** OpenJDK (GPLv2+CE) staged into `gen/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a` with `extractNativeLibs=true`. Pin `minSdkVersion` (26–29 per spike §Q5) and `ndk.abiFilters = ['arm64-v8a']` — **without an ABI filter Gradle emits an armeabi-v7a slice for which no JVM was ever built.** Size budget recorded and enforced. | L | N3.1c | android-sdk | **16 KB pages**; **`sqlite-jdbc` natives** — the premise that no native DB `.so` is needed holds **only for the pinned H2 build**; a jar bump that switches the default store makes a native `.so` mandatory and inverts the whole packaging plan (→ N-CI.10 watches for this); APK size (~120–180 MB estimate is **unmeasured**) |
| **N3.9** `[U]` | Licensing/compliance. | docs | GPLv2+CE obligations for the bundled OpenJDK discharged and documented (Play policy + source-offer). | S | N3.8 | linux | |
| **N3.7** `[U]` | **Android device proof.** | runbook | Gate II legs A+B on a physical Android device (leg C after N3.6). | M | N3.2–N3.8 | android-sdk + device | |

**Note:** no Android SDK/NDK exists on this host. Every `android-sdk` item is blocked on provisioning one.

## 8. N1/N5 — Desktop

Five supervisor findings landed this run (stale lock → heartbeat lock with takeover; engine **Basic auth** with a
per-boot 128-bit password written into `server.conf` as `server.authMode = "BASIC_AUTH"`, verified against
v2.3.2243 `ServerConfig.kt`/`AuthMode.kt`/`JavalinSetup.kt`; boot races `child.wait()`; SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL;
port-collision diagnostics). What remains:

| ID | Goal | Files | Acceptance | Size | Deps | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **N5.1** `[V]` **blocker** | **A release bundling pipeline.** `beforeBuildCommand` now chains `fetch-suwayomi-jar.sh && build-jre.sh` (landed), but **no CI job anywhere runs `tauri build`** — the only entry point is the manual `desktop:build` script. `native-sidecar.yml` ends at `upload-artifact "jre-<slug>"` with a comment about "a later bundling job" **that does not exist**. | `.github/workflows/native-sidecar.yml` | A per-target job runs the artifact scripts + `tauri build` and **asserts the produced bundle contains** `jre/<slug>/bin/java*` and `suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server.jar` (unzip/inspect the `.app`/`.deb`/`.msi`). Also **stop shipping the three internal `.md` files** now inside `bundle.resources: ["suwayomi/"]`. | M | — | CI (macos + linux + windows) |
| **N5.2** `[U]` | macOS entitlements / hardened runtime / signing for the bundled JVM. A repo-wide grep for `entitlements`, `hardenedRuntime`, `signingIdentity` returns **nothing**. | `tauri.macos.conf.json`, new entitlements plist | `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` (+ `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` / `disable-library-validation`); JRE moved under `Contents/Frameworks` **or** a signing step that signs every nested Mach-O before the outer bundle. Notarization succeeds. | M | N5.1 | **macos** |
| **N5.3** `[U]` | Kill orphaned `java` on abnormal exit. `kill_on_drop` + the explicit `stop_child` are the **only** reaping mechanisms and both require the Rust process to run code; grep finds no `pdeathsig`/`JobObject`/`libc`. | `suwayomi.rs`, `Cargo.toml` | `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL)` in a `pre_exec` on Linux; a Job Object with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` on Windows; on macOS a kqueue `NOTE_EXIT` watch (or kill any live stale PID at startup). §0a's "no orphaned java (proven)" is proven **only** for the clean path. | M | — | linux + macos + windows |
| **N5.4** `[U]` | No console window on Windows. `spawn_engine` uses a plain `Command` with no `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` and deliberately picks `java.exe` over `javaw.exe`. | `suwayomi.rs:257-276` | `#[cfg(windows)] .creation_flags(0x08000000)` and/or prefer `javaw.exe`. No console window on launch **or on any supervised restart**. | S | — | **windows** |
| **N5.5** `[V]` | **Verify a conflict between two fix groups.** The `lib-rs` agent recorded residual #4: `start()`'s early-bail paths still leave `Degraded` with no supervision task, so a quit after a failed start burns the 6 s poll. The `desktop-sup` agent claims the opposite: the CF shim and supervision loop now start from a spawned task so `stop_and_wait` **always** has a task that can reach `Stopped`. | `suwayomi.rs`, `lib.rs` | Settle it with one test: launch with no JRE/jar, quit, assert exit latency < 500 ms. (`lib.rs`'s `ENGINE_STARTED` short-circuit already covers the never-started case.) | S | — | linux |
| **N5.6** `[FIXED]` | Supervision-loop backoff coverage. | `suwayomi.rs` | Landed — `backoff_grows_and_stays_bounded` is in the 27 passing tests. | — | — | done |
| **N5.7** `[U]` | Enforce the JRE pin in CI. `build-jre.sh` now asserts JDK feature 21, emits a `jre/<slug>.manifest` with a tree digest, and fails on mismatch **when `KOMIKA_JRE_MANIFEST_SHA256` is exported** — but nothing exports it. | `native-sidecar.yml` | CI supplies the known-good digest per slug; drift becomes a build failure instead of a printed line. Pin the exact Temurin version rather than floating `java-version: '21'`. | S | N5.1 | CI |
| **N5.8** `[U]` | Mutation-surface hardening for `suwayomi_gql`. **Deliberately deferred by the fix agent** because a Rust denylist covering `addExtensionStore`/`updateExtension`/`installExternalExtension` would break the app's **own** provisioning, which legitimately calls those. | `packages/api/src/local-suwayomi-backend.ts`, `graphql-backend.ts` | A **JS-side operation allowlist** so a WebView XSS cannot drive arbitrary engine mutations, while the app's own named operations still pass. Basic auth (landed) already closes the cross-process half. Also cover `setSettings` (it can repoint `flareSolverrUrl` at an attacker host). | M | — | linux |

## 9. N-CI — CI additions

**The audit's recommendation was wrong in one specific way and is corrected here.**

| ID | Job | Runner | What it does | Size | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **N-CI.1** | `ios-cross-check` | **`macos-latest`** | `cargo check --target aarch64-apple-ios --all-targets` + `--target aarch64-apple-ios-sim`; promote to `clippy -D warnings` once green. | S | **CORRECTION:** the `testgap` lane recommended this as a **Linux** job on the grounds that `cargo check` never links. That is true of linking but **build scripts still run**: `objc2-exception-helper v0.1.1` compiles `src/try_catch.m` and needs `clang` + `xcrun --show-sdk-path`. It **dies on Linux**. This must be `macos-latest`. Still cheap and free on GitHub-hosted runners for public repos. |
| **N-CI.2** | `android-cross-check` | `ubuntu-latest` | `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android` then `cargo check --target aarch64-linux-android --all-targets`. | S | **"Try, verify."** The target is installable on this aarch64 Linux host. Whether it survives dependency build scripts is **unknown** — it was never attempted, and the iOS attempt is the cautionary tale. If it fails the same way, fold it into an Android-SDK job. This also covers `suwayomi_mobile.rs`, which is likewise compiled by nothing today. |
| **N-CI.3** | `deterministic-checks` | `ubuntu-latest` | Runs `e2e/fallback-ladder/run-fallback-check.sh` (**13 PASS**) and `e2e/offline-queue/run-offline-check.sh` (**22 PASS**) — both verified on this host, **< 1 s each, no engine, no jar, no network** — plus the new **N-IMG.9** image-routing check. | S | Put it in **`ci.yml`**, not `native-sidecar.yml`, so it triggers on `packages/api/**` changes — the path where `composite-backend.ts` and `offline-queue.ts` actually live and where `native-sidecar.yml` does **not** trigger today. Also add `packages/api/**` to `native-sidecar.yml`'s path filter. |
| **N-CI.4** | `cargo test` for the server | existing `rust` job in `ci.yml` | Add `cargo test --all-targets` between clippy and build. | S | **375 `#[test]`/`#[tokio::test]` attributes under `apps/server/src` are executed by nothing.** §0a's "server 112/0" is a developer's frozen local run. Toolchain and `rust-cache` are already warm; incremental cost is a test-binary link + run. §0a leans on those tests to discharge the "real hosted `workSources`" gap. |
| **N-CI.5** | Harden the sidecar boot smoke | existing `x86_64-linux` leg | (a) `panic!` instead of `return` when `KOMIKA_JAVA_BIN`/`KOMIKA_SUWAYOMI_JAR` are unset **while `CI` is set**; (b) `--exact suwayomi::tests::sidecar_boots_and_reports_about_server` so a rename fails instead of matching zero tests; (c) tighten the budget to 30 s and **assert measured elapsed time**; (d) add a `setSettings(flareSolverrUrl=…)` mutation + read-back against the already-booted jar. | S | Today this single step is the **only** artifact behind Gate C's "cold-start <30 s (proven)" and "no orphaned java (proven)", it uses a **60 s** budget and asserts **no timing at all**, and it has **two independent silent-pass paths**. (d) also mechanises the N-CF "live `setSettings` acceptance" claim, which is currently a one-off manual run with no transcript — and it is the assertion the entire on-device CF strategy hinges on. |
| **N-CI.6** | Engine integration test for the Rust image path | `x86_64-linux` leg | Boot via `boot_engine`, call the **real** `suwayomi_image` handler for a known `/api/v1/...` route, assert JPEG magic on the returned bytes. | M | Gate C's "live MangaDex read proven end-to-end" runs **zero lines of Rust**: hosted is a mock and `e2e/native-read/tauri-core-stub.mjs` hard-codes `suwayomi_status → {state:'ready'}` and implements `suwayomi_image` as a bare `fetch()`. `validate_image_path`, the 6-permit semaphore, the 32 MiB cap and the `tauri::ipc::Response` byte shape are all **untested**. Also make assertion E a hard fail or an explicit expected-skip — "5/5" can be 4 asserts + a silent skip. |
| **N-CI.7** | `bundle` job | macos + linux + windows | = **N5.1**: `tauri build` + bundle-content assertions + size ceilings (+ **N4.7** for iOS). | M | Without this, Gate III cannot be asserted at all. |
| **N-CI.8** | `android-premises` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` (or QEMU) | `fetch-suwayomi-jar.sh`, then a **network-free** subset: assert the jar SHA matches `VERSION`, assert `META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver` **still lists only postgresql+h2**, boot to `aboutServer`. | S | The spike's own mitigation for upstream drift is "re-run N3.1/N3.5 probes on each bump" — **there is no mechanism to do so.** A jar bump that switches the default store to `sqlite-jdbc` silently inverts the entire Android packaging plan and nobody learns for months. |
| **N-CI.9** | Ignored-test roster in the job summary | any | Print the `#[ignore]`d roster into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`; convert each `could_not_verify` item into `#[ignore = "needs a physical device: see device-verify-runbook.md §N"]` or a named `test.skip()`. | S | Every unverified item currently lives **only in Markdown prose** across five files. Prose-tracked items cannot be counted, cannot be surfaced, and rot invisibly. The repo already demonstrates the better pattern with the `#[ignore]`d boot smoke. |
| **N-CI.10** | Mechanise the gate counts | any | Emit `cargo test` and `svelte-check COMPLETED n FILES` into `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`; drop the raw counts from §0a in favour of a link. | S | §0a's "344/0/0, 13/0, 112/0" are stale in all three places (measured: 401 files, 20→27 tests, 375 server tests). Stale counts cannot detect drift — a suite that silently halves still reads as "better than documented". |

## 10. Risk register

| # | Risk | Trigger | Blast radius | Mitigation / kill-switch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** | **The blind iOS edits don't compile**, or compile but are wrong. ~410 lines of unsafe JNI were changed with zero compiler feedback; only `rustfmt` parse-checked. | First `cargo check --target aarch64-apple-ios` (N4.4). | Everything downstream on the iOS critical path. | **N4.4 first, before anything else.** It is an S. If it fails badly, the fallback is `git revert` of the `suwayomi_ios.rs` hunk — the file was never shipping-verified anyway, so reverting costs nothing but the 5 fixes. |
| **R2** | **`DetachCurrentThread` is the wrong call** on the VM-owning thread (JNI Invocation API says the creating thread cannot be detached; `DestroyJavaVM` is required). The applied fix uses `DetachCurrentThread`. | First on-device terminal-degrade path (wrong classpath / wrong Main-Class) — **the most likely first-run failure**. | Undefined behaviour in a VM thread; on iOS that is an app crash instead of a clean degrade to hosted. | **N4.5** settles it with a compiler and a device. Until then, treat the iOS terminal-degrade path as untrusted; the heartbeat that landed this run at least makes a dead engine observable. |
| **R3** | **Never getting a Mac / a provisioned device.** Two independent human-action blockers gate the entire iOS critical path. | Procurement. | The user's stated priority platform makes zero progress. Nothing on the iOS path can be substituted by Linux work. | Escalate early. In the meantime, all of **N-IMG**, **N-CF.1–10**, **N5.5/N5.8**, and every **N-CI** item except N-CI.1/N-CI.7 run on this Linux host. |
| **R4** | **Cloudflare-gated sources are never natively fetchable on mobile**, so "server-independent" is true only for a minority of sources. | Leg C of Gate II. | The headline claim is materially false for most non-MangaDex content, and — worse — **silently** so, because the fallback is invisible. | **N-CF.14 first** (telemetry on every `localUnusable`), so the hosted-fallback rate becomes a **number** rather than a belief. Then N-CF.11/12/13. Kill-switch: the §5.3 policy makes the degradation explicit and user-visible instead of a lie. |
| **R5** | **The engine path ships and is worse than the hosted path** (slower, flakier, more memory), and nobody notices because there is no comparison signal. | N-IMG.7 flipping the default. | User-visible regression on the core reading experience. | The `route=` telemetry landed this run + N-IMG.7's `localStorage` `imageMode` override = **a kill-switch that does not need a rebuild or an app-store update**. Flip the default per platform **only after** that platform's device proof. |
| **R6** | **Memory pressure kills the app on iOS.** Engine heap + jimage mapping + up to 6 × 32 MiB image buffers + metaspace, in a jetsam-limited process. | A prefetch burst during extension class-loading on a 4 GB device. | Silent cold restart mid-read; no crash report attributable to the engine. | **N-IMG.1** removes the whole-chapter buffer (the dominant term). **N4.3** measures rather than guesses. **Do not** pre-emptively cap metaspace — the refuter showed `MaxMetaspaceSize=128m` plausibly OOMs the engine outright. Consider a `#[cfg(target_os="ios")]` lower `MAX_CONCURRENT_IMAGE_FETCHES`. |
| **R7** | **A fresh clone or CI cannot build iOS at all**, because the link recipe lives only in gitignored `gen/apple/project.yml` and its only guard greps three substrings. | Anyone runs `tauri ios init`; or CI is wired up. | The app links but `JNI_CreateJavaVM` fails during `java.base` bootstrap on device → unexplained permanent `degraded`, with **no** guard (unlike the staging path, which does degrade cleanly). | **N4.6.** Also fix the guard's error text, which points at a doc that does not contain the recipe. |
| **R8** | **Android premises invert on a jar bump.** The "no native DB `.so` needed" and "H2, not sqlite-jdbc" premises hold only for pinned v2.3.2243. | `suwayomi/VERSION` bump. | The entire Android packaging plan (N3.8) changes shape; discovered months later at the first build attempt. | **N-CI.8** asserts the `java.sql.Driver` service list on every run. Pin bumps require re-running N3.1b/N3.1c. |
| **R9** | **Green CI that proves nothing.** Multiple gates currently pass vacuously: the boot smoke has two silent-pass paths, "cold-start <30 s" is asserted by a 60 s budget with no timing, "live read proven end-to-end" executes zero Rust, "server 112/0" runs no tests. | Any refactor. | False confidence — exactly how "iOS complete, device-test-blocked" got written into the plan of record. | **N-CI.4/5/6/9/10** together. Treat "a gate that can pass having run nothing" as a **P1 bug**, not hygiene. |
| **R10** | **The desktop CF shim is an unauthenticated local cookie oracle**, live on 100% of desktop installs regardless of the feature flag. | Any local process scanning loopback for the `komika-cf-shim` banner. | Full cookie jar for any site the user has logged into inside the app; plus a "render attacker HTML in a Komiq-owned window" primitive after the 8 s grace. | **N-CF.4** (token + host allowlist + cookie filter + flag-gating). The one mitigating fact already in place: `capabilities/default.json` scopes permissions to `windows: ["main"]`, so challenge windows get **no** Tauri IPC. |
| **R11** | **A slow-but-successful CF solve still degrades to hosted**, permanently for the session. | Any interactive Turnstile. | The user waits ~25–40 s, the solve succeeds, and the app serves hosted anyway until restart. | **N-CF.2** (monotonic ladder) + stop memoising on transport timeouts. |
| **R12** | **Two fix groups made contradictory claims** about whether `stop_and_wait` can now always reach `Stopped`. | App quit after a failed engine start. | 6 s zombie process on every quit of any build without a bundled JRE — i.e. every packaged build today. | **N5.5**: one test settles it. Cheap. |

## 11. Explicit non-goals

Not in scope for this roadmap. Listed so they are not re-litigated mid-execution.

1. **App Store / TestFlight public distribution.** Plan §12a decided **no App Store**. Device provisioning for
   development and internal verification **is** in scope (N4.3/N4.9 depend on it); public distribution is not.
   This also removes App Review as a risk vector for the bundled JVM.
2. **Offline downloads UI.** The offline **queue** exists and is covered by a 22-assertion deterministic check;
   wiring it into a downloads manager screen is a separate product workstream.
3. **Removing the Cloudflare Worker from web.** The Worker stays for web, unchanged. Nothing here touches
   `apps/worker/`.
4. **Server-independent *metadata*.** Only **image bytes** are in scope. Catalogue, search, GraphQL, auth, social
   and progress sync stay hosted; Gate II-2 deliberately permits `api.komiq.cc/graphql` traffic.
5. **Mac Catalyst.** Now correctly falls back to the mobile stub (`target_abi = ""` allowlist, landed) — that is
   the intended end state, not a stepping stone. (`build.rs:47-50` must be aligned to match.)
6. **A JIT JVM on iOS.** The runtime is interpreter-only Zero by necessity; all performance thresholds assume it.
7. **Non-arm64 Android ABIs.** `arm64-v8a` only, enforced by `ndk.abiFilters` (N3.8).
8. **Rewriting the engine or forking Suwayomi.** The whole N-CF design exists to avoid a fork; stay on the pinned
   stock jar.
9. **The following three findings are CLOSED as refuted** and must not be re-opened without new evidence:
   - `ios-unbounded-non-heap-memory` — direct buffers default to `Runtime.maxMemory()` (already capped by
     `-Xmx256m`); there is **no** JIT code cache on a Zero VM; per-thread stacks **are** bounded by `-Xss`; and the
     proposed `MaxMetaspaceSize=128m` is a **live regression risk**.
   - `ios-jvm-thread-panic-leaves-starting` — no reachable panic site, and no behavioural delta (`starting`,
     `degraded` and `stopped` all map to `isReady() === false` identically; `lastError` is read by **zero** call
     sites).
   - `desktop-runtime-artifacts-unverified-and-env-overridable` — the env-override "attack" requires code execution
     as the user, i.e. it crosses no trust boundary; and the app **by design** loads unsigned, remotely-fetched
     extension code from a user-writable dir one directory over. Gating the override would break the documented
     and currently **only** working escape hatch. (Worth doing: a loud `WARN` when an override is honoured in a
     release build. Nothing more.)

## 12. Appendix — state of the working tree (this run)

Applied and gate-green, but **uncommitted**:

- `apps/reader/src-tauri/src/suwayomi_ios.rs` — 5 fixes, **compiler-unverified** (see R1/R2).
- `apps/reader/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — 6 fixes: API-origin SSRF exemption (env-driven, **no IPC setter**), image
  retry + 60 s total budget, unconditional logger, lazy engine start (`suwayomi_start` + `ENGINE_STARTED`),
  `macabi` allowlist.
- `apps/reader/src-tauri/src/suwayomi.rs` — 5 fixes: heartbeat lockfile with stale takeover, engine **Basic auth**,
  boot child-exit race, SIGTERM ladder, port-collision diagnostics.
- `apps/reader/src/lib/data/source.ts` + `Cover.svelte` — `Promise.allSettled`, cover blob release.
- `Cargo.toml` (MSRV → 1.78), `tauri.conf.json` (production CSP tightened, `devCsp` added), `build-jre.sh` (JDK-21
  assertion + tree digest manifest + mobile no-op), `stage-ios-jvm-runtime.sh` (hardened).

**Open from the fix set:** `ios-bundle-size-and-desktop-jre-leak-ungated` (→ N4.7),
`android-isready-ipc-per-call` (→ N-IMG.11).

**Cross-file remainders flagged by the fix agents, all now roadmap items:** `build.rs:47-50` ABI gate must match
`lib.rs` (§6 preamble); `context.ts` must call `invoke('suwayomi_start')` (N-IMG.7); `build.rs` must forward
`PUBLIC_KOMIKA_API` / `PUBLIC_KOMIKA_NATIVE_ENGINE` as `cargo:rustc-env` or the origin exemption and the
`route=hosted` telemetry label are inert in shipped builds (N-IMG.7).

The working tree also contains **unrelated in-progress server browse/catalogue work**, untouched by this run and
out of scope here.
