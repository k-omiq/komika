//! Mobile (iOS/Android) stubs for the embedded Suwayomi engine.
//!
//! The desktop engine (`suwayomi.rs`) is a child-process JVM supervisor: it spawns a
//! `java` sidecar, brokers a loopback port, and runs a WebView Cloudflare shim
//! (`cloudflare.rs`). None of that applies on mobile — there is no `java` to spawn and
//! no child-process model on iOS — so on those targets the whole desktop implementation
//! is compiled out (`#[cfg(desktop)]`) and this module takes its place under the same
//! `suwayomi` module name (see `lib.rs`'s `#[path]` alias).
//!
//! An in-process JVM (a "Zero JVM") is a later phase. Until then these stubs keep the
//! four IPC commands REGISTERED (the JS side always invokes them by name), but they
//! report the engine as unavailable so the JS fallback ladder routes to the hosted
//! backend rather than hanging or crashing:
//!   * `suwayomi_status`   → `state: "degraded"` (mirrors the desktop "engine
//!                            unavailable" transition). JS `isReady()` returns false, so
//!                            `CompositeBackend.localReady()` is false and content stays
//!                            hosted.
//!   * `suwayomi_base_url` → `None` (no loopback engine to point at).
//!   * `suwayomi_gql` / `suwayomi_image` → a plain `Err(..)` string (never a panic); the
//!                            JS `.catch` paths fall back to hosted. In practice these are
//!                            unreachable while `isReady()` is false, but they must exist.
//!
//! Startup (`start`) is a NO-OP: no java spawn, no restart loop, no cloudflare shim, no
//! background threads. `SuwayomiSupervisor` is an empty placeholder kept only so `lib.rs`
//! can `manage` it and the shutdown hook can call `stop_and_wait` uniformly.
