//! `all.mangadex` retirement.
//!
//! The `all.mangadex` Suwayomi extension mirrors MangaDex through Suwayomi. We also
//! mirror MangaDex *directly* (`source_type = 'mangadex'`), which is the richer path:
//! only it has `createdAt` windowing, `links`, full `altTitles`, tags, `year`,
//! `content_rating`, and pages off `*.mangadex.network` instead of our origin. So 10,479
//! `source_series` rows on one source id (`2499283573021220255`) are duplication that
//! consumes the shared Suwayomi scan budget and mints duplicate `w_` works.
//!
//! # Why this module exists rather than a five-line DELETE
//!
//! §7's step 3 gate — "verify every work has a `source_type = 'mangadex'` anchor" — does
//! **not** protect step 4's delete, and §8g proved it on the 2026-07-31 snapshot:
//!
//! | class | rows |
//! |---|---|
//! | UUID of the row == a direct anchor's `source_key` on the SAME work | 9,929 |
//! | work HAS an anchor, but this row points at a **different** MangaDex entry | 54 |
//! | work has NO anchor at all | 496 |
//!
//! Those 54 pass §7's gate cleanly (their work does have *an* anchor) and carry 4,178
//! `chapter` rows. `chapter.source_series_id` is `REFERENCES source_series(id) ON DELETE
//! CASCADE`, so §7-as-written would have cascaded them away silently. They are
//! colored/version/fan editions mis-merged onto the base work (*Kaguya-sama (Official
//! Colored)* 371 ch on the work whose own anchor has 47).
//!
//! **The safety property this module implements is therefore UUID-level, not
//! work-level:** a row is deletable only if its MangaDex UUID equals the `source_key` of
//! a `source_type = 'mangadex'` row on the same work *after `work_redirect`
//! resolution* ([`gate`]).
//!
//! # The five steps
//!
//! 1. [`record_uuids`] — persist every row's MangaDex UUID, read from Suwayomi's
//!    `MangaType.url` (`/manga/<uuid>`), into `all_mangadex_uuid` (migration 0096, whose
//!    header justifies why neither `source_series.source_url` nor `work_external_id` can
//!    be the durable home) plus `source_series.source_url` for as long as the row lives.
//! 2. [`merge_anchorless`] — the 486 anchorless works are duplicate `w_` rows, not
//!    uncatalogued content: §8g measured that all 496 of their UUIDs already exist as a
//!    direct anchor on a *different* work (495 distinct twins, 0 on the same work). So
//!    this is a MERGE onto the existing canonical work, via `catalog::merge_works_ex`,
//!    which is what re-points the referential hazards (see below).
//! 3. [`gate`] — the rewritten redundancy proof. Reports every failing row; the caller
//!    does not proceed past one.
//! 4. [`split_mismatched`] — the 54 mismatch rows are **not deleted**. See that
//!    function's docs for why re-pointing ("split") is the only available action and a
//!    merge would be wrong.
//! 5. [`enrolment_excluded_source_ids`] — all **61** registered `all.mangadex` source
//!    ids are excluded from source-sync enrolment (`sync::sync_extension_inner`), not
//!    just the 1 that carries rows, so a language source that is empty today cannot
//!    re-seed the extension tomorrow.
//!
//! # The delete is OFF BY DEFAULT
//!
//! [`delete_redundant`] reports what it *would* delete unless it is given
//! [`Apply::Yes`] **and** the confirmation token [`DELETE_CONFIRM_TOKEN`]. Nothing in
//! this module deletes a `source_series` row on any other path.

/// * **22,991 `release_event`** rows — moved by `ledger::merge_release_events` BEFORE
///   the `work` delete, taking the earliest `first_seen_at` per chapter key, which is
///   what stops the merged-in back catalogue re-announcing itself on /updates.
/// * **486 `browse_catalogue` + 37 `feed_series_updates`** rows — these cascade off the

/// all 54 mismatch UUIDs are ALREADY a `source_type = 'mangadex'` row on another work,
/// and all 54 are already in `work_external_id`. `source_series` is
/// `UNIQUE (source_type, source_id, source_key)` and `work_external_id` is
/// `PRIMARY KEY (provider, external_id)` — globally unique, not per-work — so creating
/// the anchor on this work would either fail or require stealing the id from its owner.
///
/// That leaves the split, and the split is also the better of the two on its merits:
///
/// * It is **one `UPDATE`** and it deletes nothing. The alternative reading of "split"
///   (fold the twin work INTO this work) would destroy 51 works to paper over a mapping
///   error, and destroy the very distinction MangaDex draws between a base series and
///   its colored/version edition.
/// * It is **reversible**: `all_mangadex_uuid.prev_work_id` records the work the row came
///   from, so the move is undone with one `UPDATE` per row.
/// * It **loses no chapters**: nothing is deleted, and the row keeps every `chapter` it
///   had. (Measured on the snapshot: for 0 of the 54 does the all.mangadex row hold more
///   chapters than the direct mirror of the *same* UUID. §8g's "~40 hold MORE chapters"
///   compares against the work's OWN anchor, i.e. against a different MangaDex entry —
///   which is exactly the mis-merge, not evidence of unique content.)
/// * It makes the mapping TRUE rather than making the catalogue coarser: after it, the
///   row sits on the work whose direct anchor is its own UUID.
///
/// `release_event` is moved with the row, but only for chapter keys the row was the sole
/// source of on the old work (`first_source_series_id` is this row AND no remaining
/// source of the old work still has that key). Anything else stays: the old work still
/// has that chapter from another source, and the ledger's rule is earliest-anywhere.
///
/// **These rows are still not deleted**, here or by [`delete_redundant`] (which carves
