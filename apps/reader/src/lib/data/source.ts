 *    weeks STALE (2026-06-27 vs the list's 2026-07-10), so the list is also better.
 *  • Cold series — the server stamps `latest_chapter_at = now` on first touch and
 *    only corrects it once chapters are cached. Probing ids 500/3000/9000/12345/
 *    16796 cold returned `latestChapterAt == updatedAt == <the query's own clock>`;
 *    a second probe returned their real historical dates. So the first GET of
 *    /series/1292 rendered "Updated now" — with the tooltip asserting "Newest
 *    chapter released now" — directly above a chapter list whose newest row read
 *    "13d", and the next GET rendered "13d" correctly.
 *
 * A page contradicting itself one line down is worse than a coarse label, and the
