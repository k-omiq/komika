//! Adaptive scan scheduler.
//!
//! A background tokio task that keeps the federated library catalog fresh. Every
//! `SCAN_TICK_SECONDS` it selects — straight from the DB, indexed on `next_scan_at` —
//! only the series that have reached their persisted `next_scan_at` and re-scans those.
//! It does NOT fetch the whole Suwayomi library per tick, so tick cost scales with the
//! DUE set, not the catalogue size (which matters at 100k+ series). Enrolment and the
//! daily source-sync reconcile (`crate::sync`) guarantee every enrolled series has a
//! `series_scan_state` row for this query to find. That schedule is adaptive:
//!
//!   steady_interval = admin override_interval_hours  (if set)
//!                     else rolling avg gap between chapter uploads
//!                     (clamped into `[MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS, ACTIVE_MAX_INTERVAL_HOURS]`)
//!
//! POLL CADENCE IS NOT PUBLICATION CADENCE. The scheduler used to poll a series at
//! its own rolling upload gap, which guarantees an average detection lag on the order
//! of that gap: a fortnightly series was polled fortnightly, so its chapter was found,
//! on average, a week late. Production measured a p50 discovery lag of 28.8h against a
//! 300s tick that was nowhere near saturated. The inferred average is now used ONLY to
//! judge *lateness*; the poll cadence of a non-paused series is capped at
//! `ACTIVE_MAX_INTERVAL_HOURS`, which bounds worst-case discovery lag by construction.
//! Paused series still park at `PAUSED_PARK_HOURS` (see `park_paused`).
//!
//! After a scan finds a new chapter (or on first observation) the next scan is
//! scheduled a full `steady_interval` out. A series whose next chapter is GENUINELY
//! late — its newest upload is older than `LATE_FACTOR x` its own trustworthy
//! publication cadence, but not so old that the series has plainly died
//! (`LATE_BAND_MAX x`) — enters an "awaiting" state and is re-polled at the (clamped)
//! admin `poll_every_minutes` cadence. The accelerated poll runs for
//! `min(publication_interval, AWAITING_MAX_HOURS)` and then falls back to the steady
//! (<= 12h) cadence; the streak start is retained as a cool-down marker so the window
//! cannot immediately re-open, and is re-armed after `AWAITING_REARM_HOURS`.
//!
//! Lateness is deliberately NOT "a scheduled scan found nothing": `due_series_ids`
//! only ever returns rows that are already due, so that test is true by construction
//! and used to route ~73% of the fetch budget to a few hundred series.
//!
//! Due series get their chapters re-fetched; new chapters (detected by chapter
//! count OR max chapter number vs. the last known values) are logged. All derived
//! state is persisted in `series_scan_state`, which `graphql::map_series` folds
//! back into `Series.scan` for the client and admin console.
//!
//! Resilience: a per-series error is logged and skipped — it never aborts the tick
//! or the loop. The loop exits cleanly when the provided shutdown signal fires.

/// skipping this would be a freshness REGRESSION against the behaviour the feed
/// replaced — and late chapters are the complaint the whole scan-cadence effort exists
/// to fix.
///
/// GATED ON `new_found`, not on "a scan happened". `persist_scan` runs on every scan
/// (~475+/hr in steady state) but only a detection can change anything this feed sorts
/// or labels by: `released_at` comes from `suwayomi_series.latest_chapter_at`, which
/// `series_cache::derive_latest_chapter_at` only advances when a chapter appears, and
/// `detected_at` is `series_scan_state.last_new_chapter_at`, which `record_scan` only
/// stamps on a detection. So an unchanged scan has nothing worth a write — this turns
/// ~475 writes/hr into a handful.
///
/// WHAT THE GATE MISSES, exhaustively. Each is bounded by the next rebuild, and none of
/// them is worse than the rebuild-only behaviour this call was added to:
///
/// * an upstream edit to an EXISTING chapter's `upload_date`. The max-merge below would
///   refuse to move the row backwards for a correction anyway;
/// * a pure upstream DELETION. It lowers `suwayomi_series.chapter_count` without
///   producing a detection, and that column IS a label for a scanner-only card (the
///   reader renders `Ch. {latest_chapter ?? chapter_count}`), so such a card can read one
///   chapter high until the rebuild — the same single stale number it would have read for
///   the whole interval without this call;
/// * display metadata the periodic rebuild owns outright (`title`, `reader_id`,
///   `latest_chapter`), which the conflict clause never rewrites in any case.
///
/// BEST-EFFORT, like the cache writes above: logged and swallowed, never propagated. A

/// display metadata the conflict clause deliberately never rewrites — `title`,
/// `reader_id`, `latest_chapter`, and a `cover_url` whose `?v=` has since been bumped: on
/// a row THIS path created, those stay frozen at the first write until the next rebuild.
/// That is the same staleness the rebuild-only behaviour had (nothing here makes a column
/// worse than not running at all), and it is the price of the mirror-wins rule below —
/// this statement cannot tell "the existing row is the mirror half" from "the existing row
/// is my own earlier write", and clobbering a mirror row's title would be the worse bug.
///
/// The only narrowing is the `IN (SELECT …)`, which restricts the rebuild's query to the
/// work this series maps to. Load-bearing details, all inherited:
///
/// * `released_at` is INTEGER EPOCH-MILLIS, never TEXT. The two halves' clocks are stored
///   in incompatible text encodings (ISO-8601 vs 13-digit millis) and under BINARY
///   collation every `'2…'` sorts above every `'1…'`, so a TEXT key would silently sort
///   the entire mirror half above the entire scanner half. See migration 0064.
/// * `MAX(existing, excluded)` on `released_at`: an incremental write may only move a row
///   FORWARD in time, and can never pull it back below a fresher mirror-half value.
/// * `reader_id` is the canonical `w_…` id when the work is mangadex-anchored (the anchor
///   test in the SELECT) and the numeric Suwayomi id otherwise, and is left untouched on
///   CONFLICT — so a mangadex-anchored work navigates to its canonical page whether the
///   mirror half won the insert race or (a takedown) never fired at all.
/// * rows with no release time are excluded (`latest_chapter_at IS NOT NULL`) rather than
///   inserted with a NULL into a NOT NULL column.
///
/// Two conflict-clause assignments are stated in the *converged* direction rather than
/// copied verbatim, because the rebuild's clause is written for a table whose only
/// pre-existing row is the mirror half inserted moments earlier in the same transaction,
/// and here the pre-existing row may be an older SCANNER row:
///
/// * `chapter_count` takes `excluded` when we have one — and we ALWAYS have one, because
///   `suwayomi_series.chapter_count` is `INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` (migration 0022), so
///   the fallback arm is dead and this is unconditionally the current Suwayomi count. In
///   the rebuild the existing value at conflict time is always the mirror half's literal
///   NULL (the table is DELETEd first, and the mirror insert writes NULL into this
///   column), so `COALESCE(existing, excluded)` there lands that same count. The two
///   writers therefore converge exactly. Copying it literally would instead pin the count at whatever
///   the first incremental write saw, and the reader renders
///   `Ch. {latest_chapter ?? chapter_count}` — a scanner-only card would announce a new
///   chapter while still printing the old number.
/// * `comic_type` is filled ONLY when missing (below), never changed. The rebuild's
///   `fill_feed_series_updates_types` pass owns it; but that pass cannot see a row that
///   did not exist when it ran, and a NULL type is invisible to the reader's format
///   filter — so a series whose FIRST-ever detection lands here would appear in the
///   unfiltered feed and vanish from every format tab until the next rebuild.
/// * `status` / `content_rating` (migration 0068) ARE assigned on conflict, unlike every
///   other display field, because they are properties of the WORK rather than of the half
///   that published the row: both writers derive them from the same `work` row through the
///   same `catalog::FSU_STATUS_SQL`, so `excluded` and the existing value always agree.
///   They must not be left out: `status` is nullable, and a NULL is invisible to Browse's
///   status filter for exactly the same reason a NULL `comic_type` is invisible to the
///   format tabs — a series whose first detection lands here would otherwise sit in the
///   unfiltered catalogue and vanish from every status filter until the next rebuild.
/// * `en_chapter_count` cannot be expressed in the conflict clause at all and is filled by
///   [`fill_feed_en_chapter_count`] immediately after; see there.
///
/// Finally, [`mirror_feed_row_into_browse_catalogue`] copies the finished row onto Browse's
/// own table (migration 0069). Browse stopped reading THIS table, so without that copy the
