//! Phase C1 — the release ledger: who announced each chapter first, and when.
//!
//! `release_event` (migration 0091) answers one question the rest of the system could not
//! ask: *has this chapter already been announced?* `feed_series_updates` is keyed by WORK,
//! so it has no place to record that, and the consequence is F7 — a second source mirroring
//! a chapter a first source already reported re-floats the card to the top of /updates.
//!
//! Everything here exists to fill that table without ever putting a wrong time in it.
//!
//! THE ONE RULE THAT MATTERS: `first_seen_at` COMES FROM THE CHAPTER, NEVER FROM `now()`.
//! Seeding 1.3 M back-catalogue events with the current time would put the entire history
//! of the catalogue on page 1 of /updates, in one deploy, irreversibly as far as any user
//! is concerned. Every write below takes its time from
//! `COALESCE(chapter.readable_at, chapter.published_at)` and refuses anything it cannot
//! date — and [`assert_no_future_events`] is the backstop that proves it.
