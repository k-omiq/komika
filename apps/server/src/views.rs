//! Per-series view (chapter-read) tracking — the popularity signal behind Trending
//! and the series-page "views" stat.
//!
//! A "view" is recorded once per chapter open (the reader fires `recordView` when a
//! chapter loads), for **everyone** — logged-in or anonymous — because popularity is a
//! public engagement signal (the product decision is to count all reads, not dedupe
//! per user). That is why this is a dedicated no-auth path and NOT piggybacked on
//! `setProgress`, which requires a user and fires on every page-position save.
//!
//! Counts are keyed by a NORMALISED series key (`view_key`) so a series read under
//! either identity accrues to one total. Numeric Suwayomi ids are the primary display
//! identity (home / browse / library / the `series(id)` query all use them), so keys
//! normalise TOWARD the numeric id: a canonical `w_` work read via its work page folds
//! into its Suwayomi source id when it has one — that way Trending links to the same
//! page the rest of the app uses. A pure MangaDex work with no Suwayomi source keeps
//! its `w_` key.
//!
//! Storage (migration 0036):
//!   - `series_views`       — all-time total per key (one row per series).
//!   - `series_view_bucket` — hourly counts per key for the 24h / 7d windows and for
//!     ranking Trending; pruned beyond [`BUCKET_RETENTION_HOURS`] by the GC sweep.
