//! One canonical way to turn whatever a source calls a chapter into what we show
//! (Phase A2). Every surface — updates feed, home, browse, series detail, source detail,
//! the reader — goes through this, so "Ch. N" means the same thing everywhere.
//!
//! WHAT THIS REPLACES. Four different ad-hoc rules, three of which printed something that
//! is not a chapter number:
//!
//!   * `feed_series_updates` inserts `latest_chapter = NULL` for the scanner half and the
//!     reader falls back to `chapterCount` — a series with 412 chapters renders "Ch. 412"
//!     whether its newest chapter is 412 or 10.5 (F4).
//!   * `map_canonical_chapter` parses the number with `.unwrap_or(0.0)`, so every oneshot
//!     that reaches the reader is "Chapter 0".
//!   * `work_source_chapters` excludes non-numeric chapters outright, so 21,422 works
//!     (18.5% of the catalogue) have no chapter list at all (F2).
//!   * The continue-reading card renders `read + 1` — a progress index, not a number.
//!
//! THE NUMBER COMES FROM THE CHAPTER, NEVER FROM A COUNT. In precedence order: the
//! source's structured number; else the first number embedded in the chapter's name; else
//! it is not a numbered chapter and says so.
