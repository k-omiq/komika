-- Browse over the WHOLE canonical catalogue: one materialized row per browsable work,
-- including the 67,000 works that have no chapter we can date.
--
-- WHY THIS TABLE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT MORE COLUMNS ON `feed_series_updates`
--
-- Browse (migrations 0064 + 0068) pages `feed_series_updates`, which is 48,567 of the
-- 115,567 browsable works. That table's contract is explicit and load-bearing: "a work
-- with no dated chapter is not an update, so it is EXCLUDED from the feed rather than
-- sorted last" (0064, on `released_at NOT NULL`). The Updates page, `graphql::updates_feed`
-- and several tests all depend on it, so widening it with NULL-`released_at` rows would
-- corrupt the updates feed to fix Browse. Hence a second, wider materialization.
--
-- The 67,000 excluded works are not the obscure tail. MangaDex REMOVES chapters when a
-- series is licensed or claimed, so "no chapters upstream" correlates with POPULAR:
-- `Boku no Hero Academia` (58 aliases), `Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind`,
-- `Koukaku Kidoutai: THE GHOST IN THE SHELL`, `Houseki no Kuni`, `Chi's Sweet Home` are
-- all in that set. 3,239 of them already carry a Suwayomi source mapping, i.e. chapters
-- for them will arrive from a source that is not MangaDex. Hiding them hid exactly what
-- people search for.
--
-- SCOPE, measured on production 2026-07-27: `work` = 115,569; works with no
-- `source_series` at all = 2 (EXCLUDED — there is no source to open, and `canonicalSeries`
-- + the Suwayomi path both need one); works with an empty title = 0. So 115,567 rows here,
-- of which 86,603 are visible to an anonymous viewer and 28,964 are effective-NSFW.
-- Merge-retired works are NOT a concern: a merge DELETEs the losing `work` row (0 survive
-- in production), and the `work_id` foreign key below cascades, so a merge cannot leave a
-- duplicate card behind.
--
-- PURE CACHE, same contract as 0064/0068: every column is derived from `work` /
-- `source_series` / `chapter` / `suwayomi_series` / `feed_series_updates`, and the table is
-- rewritten by `catalog::refresh_browse_catalogue` at boot and once per catalogue-sync
-- cycle. The backfill at the bottom of this file exists so Browse is correct on the very
-- FIRST request after startup: that refresh is spawned ~20 s into boot (see `main`), and
-- without a backfill Browse would serve an empty catalogue until it landed.
--
-- WHERE THE VALUES COME FROM. For a work that HAS a `feed_series_updates` row, every
-- overlapping column is COPIED VERBATIM from it — including its NULLs — rather than
-- re-derived. Two reasons: the derivations are already written and reviewed there (the
-- effective-NSFW COALESCE, the epoch-millis clock, the mirror-wins merge of the two
-- halves), and a Browse card must not disagree with the same work's Updates card. Verified
-- on a copy of production: 0 of the 48,567 shared rows differ on any copied column. For
-- the other 67,000 the same expressions are applied to `work` directly.

-- `WHERE (? = 1 OR is_nsfw = 0)` is opaque to the planner, which then cannot tell `is_nsfw`
-- is constant and sorts the whole table through a temp B-tree to satisfy the ORDER BY.

-- COUNT index-only, which is what `total` and the pager are computed from. `en_chapter_count`

-- cost a table lookup per counted row; on the other four it is the sort key already.
--
-- `work_id DESC` is the mandatory tiebreaker on every one of them. Not cosmetic: 67,000 rows
-- share `released_at IS NULL` and ~76k share an `en_chapter_count` in the 0..5 range, so
