//! Catalogue-wide Browse: the filtered, sorted, paged read behind `search(query: "")`.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. Browse used to be `series_cache::search_catalogue`, and it
//! read `suwayomi_series WHERE in_library = 1` — 13,847 rows of the 115,567 browsable
//! canonical works, keyed by numeric Suwayomi id, one fixed ORDER BY, and a genre filter
//! that `LIKE`-scanned a JSON blob. That belonged in `series_cache` because it really was
//! a query over the Suwayomi source cache. This is not: it reads `browse_catalogue`
//! (migration 0069), `work_tag`, `reviews` and `series_view_bucket`, none of which
//! are Suwayomi-cache tables, and it returns canonical works. `series_cache`'s module doc
//! is "DB cache for Suwayomi source-series metadata + chapter lists"; keeping this here
//! keeps that true. The COUNT memo moved with it — `search_catalogue` was its only other
//! user and is deleted.
//!
//! WHY `browse_catalogue` AND NOT `feed_series_updates`. It paged the feed until migration
//! 0069, which is 48,567 works — the ones with a chapter we can date. That excluded 67,000
//! browsable works, and NOT the obscure tail: MangaDex removes chapters when a series is
//! licensed or claimed, so "no chapters upstream" correlates with POPULAR (`Boku no Hero
//! Academia`, `Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind`, `Houseki no Kuni`), and 3,239 of those
//! works already have a Suwayomi source that will supply chapters. The feed's contract is
//! that a work with no dated chapter is not an update and is therefore EXCLUDED (0064), so
//! Browse moved to a table that can hold them with a NULL `released_at` instead of widening
//! the updates feed. `hasChapters` is the filter for a reader who only wants what they can
//! read right now.
//!
//! THE THREE INVARIANTS EVERYTHING BELOW IS SHAPED BY
//!
//! 1. **The WHERE is built ONCE** and formatted into both the page statement and the
//!    COUNT statement, with binds pushed in the same order. The sort may change the ORDER
//!    BY and it may add an exclusion for a two-phase sort's second half, but it must never
//!    change the filter — the moment it does, `total` stops describing the paged set and
//!    the pager's "showing 61-90 of N" becomes fiction. Same precedent as
//!    `graphql::updates_feed`.
//! 2. **Every branchable predicate is BRANCHED into the SQL text, never parameterized.**
//!    `WHERE (? = 1 OR f.is_nsfw = 0)` is opaque to the planner: it cannot tell `is_nsfw`
//!    is constant, so it cannot use the index's leading column and falls back to sorting
//!    all 115k rows through a temp B-tree. Migration 0064's header and `updates_feed` both
//!    document this. `comic_type` is branched for the same reason — as an equality it
//!    becomes an index prefix, so one index serves filter AND order.
//! 3. **Every sort carries `f.work_id DESC` as a tiebreaker.** Not cosmetic: ~76,000 rows
//!    share an `en_chapter_count` in the 0..5 range and 67,000 share `released_at IS NULL`,
//!    and without a total order LIMIT/OFFSET repeats or skips rows at a page boundary.
